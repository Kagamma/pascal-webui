## Text editor

1. [Download nightly build of WebUI library](https://github.com/webui-dev/webui/releases/tag/nightly) and put it next to the `text_editor.lpi` file
2. Open the `text_editor.lpi` file in Lazarus
3. Compile, thats it

Note that WebUI is x64 only, its already set up in the Lazarus Project Information file. You may want to change target OS (its Win64 by default).
